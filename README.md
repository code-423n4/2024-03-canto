# Additional context

## Main invariants

1. ASDRouter native balance should always be zero.
2. ASDRouter balance of any token should always be zero after lzCompose has completed
3. ASDUSDC usdcBalances mapping should always sum to the totalSupply

✅ SCOUTS: Please format the response above 👆 so its not a wall of text and its readable.

## Attack ideas (where to focus for bugs)
Since Layer Zero executors call "lzCompose" after sending funds to the ASDRouter Contract, this "lzCompose" function should never revert. All external calls should be checked for success and decoding bytes must never fail. All errors should result in refunds so that tokens do not get trapped in Layer Zero Protocol.

## All trusted roles in the protocol

1. ASDUSDC owner (setting whitelist for tokens)
